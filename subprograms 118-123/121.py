""" Create a program that will allow the user to easily manage a list of names. You should 
display a menu that will allow them to add a name to the list, change a name in the 
list, delete a name from the list or view all the names in the list. There should also be a 
menu option to allow the user to end the program. If they select an option that is not 
relevant, then it should display a suitable message. After they have made a selection 
to either add a name, change a name, delete a name or view all the names, they 
should see the menu again without having to restart the program. The program 
should be made as easy to use as possible.
